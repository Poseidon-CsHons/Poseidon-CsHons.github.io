                    Cooperative behavior can be found in many insect societies, and is advantages to the long term survival of a species.
                    <br>
                    <br> Observations of cooperative societies by Reeve and Holldobler [Reference], have revealed several organizational trends relating to the increase in cooperation between members of certain species. These trends have provided insight into the origins of cooperation and from these observations the game-theoretical Nested Tug-of-War model was developed.
                </p>
                <p class="lead3">
                    <br> (i) Cooperation is more likely to occur between agents which are genetically related.
                    <br>(ii) Large colony sizes lead to higher levels of cooperation.
                    <br>(iii) Inter-group competition is strongly associated with intra-group cooperation.

                    <br> Our objective was to simulate biological species in order to test the above three of the organizational trends put forward by the model. In order to do this, an Agent-Based simulation was constructed which would facilitate three separate experiments, the aim of each being to evaluate a single aspect of the model. Together, our results serve as an assessment of the model as a whole and provided insight into the possible origins of cooperation in biological societies

                            How eusociality (and cooperation in general) may have evolved is a question of great interest and importance in the field of biology. Several theories, such as Kin Selection [Hamilton 1963], Reciprocal Altruism [Trivers 1971], and Tug-of-War Theory [Reeve and H¨olldobler 2007], attempt to understand the evolution of such behaviour.
                            <br>
                            <br>This research will focus primarily on Tug-of-War Theory: specifically, the model proposed by Reeve and H¨olldobler [2007].
                            <br>
                            <br>Their model suggests that cooperative behaviour emerges as a bi-product of a nested tug-of-war. Agents within the same group compete for resources gathered by their group, and groups compete with each other for the limited resources available in the environment.

                            All agents in this model have the capacity for selfishness. They may choose to not expend any energy foraging for resources, knowing that they will get a share of what is collected by other agents in their group. This situation describes intragroup competition.
                            <br>
                            <br>Conversely, an agent may choose to expend its own limited energy searching for resources that will be shared amongst its group. This situation implicitly defines intragroup cooperation [Reeve and H¨olldobler 2007]. In the real world, superorganisms exhibit the following key organizational trends [Wilson and H¨olldobler 2005].
                            <br>
                            <br>(1) Cooperation is more likely to occur between agents with similar genetics.
                            <br>
                            <br>(2) Large colony sizes lead to higher levels of cooperation.
                            <br>
                            <br>(3) As colony size increases, brood output decreases.
                            <br>
                            <br>(4) Resource patchiness and inter-group competition are strongly associated with cooperation.
                            <br>
                            <br>By changing group size, levels of inter-group competition and genetic relatedness Reeve and H¨olldobler [2007] found that the above correlations emerged elegantly from their model.

                            The agent population consisted of multiple agents, each with a randomly generated Artificial Neural Network (ANN), by making use of a Cauchy Distribution for weight initialisation.
                            <br>
                            <br> ANNs are based on the biology of the brain, where the interconnected nodes making up the ANN can be compared to the interconnected neurons of the brain [32]. The links between the nodes in the ANN can be thought of as synapses.
                            <br>
                            <br> ANNs are able to provide a robust approach to approximating functions where, as shown by Cybenko [14] a fully-connected neural network with a single hidden layer is able to approximate any continuous function (Universal Function Approximator). These structures are therefore useful when simulating biological behaviour.
                            <br>
                            <br> The ANN held a one to one mapping [63] where the genotype consisted of a vector of floating point values which represented the ANN weights. Agents required an ANN design that was able to represent both cooperative and selfish behaviour and thus the inputs needed to be carefully chosen.
                            <br>
                            <br> The inputs to the ANN therefore consisted of a scaled value of both the agent’s current energy and the squared distance between the agent and its closest resource. Based on this input the agents’ ANN output value would determine how they would like to act within the environment and foraging task at hand (act selfishly or cooepratively).

                        Automated controller design [18, 55] is a process used to create novel agent controllers without the need for human interaction. Controllers are responsible for the actions of agents within an environment, and must be designed to be able to perform as best as possible for the task at hand (for example, resource foraging, reproduction, collaborative box pushing).
                        <br>
                        <br> Although it is possible for these to be designed by hand (known as heuristic controllers), these are limited as they cannot anticipate all possible situations in complex environments.

                            <br> It does so by using an EA to search for specific network configurations within a set of candidate solutions by crossing over and mutating agent ANNs, finally producing adapted offspring. The weights control an agent’s behaviour [41], and therefore as these weights are adapted the agent’s behaviour is refined.

                            <br> This process results in the autonomous creation and evolution of agent controllers. Due to the use of the EAs, NE is helpful to use in situations where we do not know correct training examples and acts as a form of unsupervised learning.

                            This study investigated the origins of cooperation by analysing the effects of individual relatedness and patch richness on the levels of cooepration observed. As a secondary measure, other factors leading to the evolution of cooperation were explored.
                            <br>
                            <br> A range of relatedness values were tested in four different environments with varying resource distributions. The results showed a positive relationship between agent relatedness and the level of cooperation experienced.
                            <br>
                            <br> The study was therefore able to agree with the trend mentioned in the Nested Tug-of-War model, indicating that higher levels of agents realtedness lead to higher levels of within-grou pcooepration. The results further indicated that other factors, for example, Patch Richness (environmental competition), were also found to affect the levels of cooperation found.

                            The Nested Tug-of-War model predicts higher within and between group cooperation levels in large groups when compared to small groups of agents. Artificial Life (AL) experiments are conducted to test the null hypothesis: <em>Group size effects the level of cooperation of a group</em>
                            <br>
                            <br> The AL experiments conducted used 2 groups where on of the groups starting size if fixed to 2000 and the other had a varying size of 200, 400, 600, 800 and 1000 agents.
                            <br>
                            <br> The level of cooperation in this study was defined by a fitness function. The results of the experiment demonstrated that the starting size of a group, and hence its group size, has an effect on the level of cooperation, in particular, the levels of between group cooperation. An example of the groups fitness is illustrated below.

                            Competition was facilitated by resource patchiness. Five difference environments were created with different resource distributions.
                            <br>
                            <br> The simulation was run 250 times up until 200 generations on each of the resource environments. The level of cooperation that evolved was recorded.
                            <br>
                            <br> Results from the experiments show that there was a statistically significant effect of between-group competition on within-group cooperation.
                            <br> Increase between-group competition led to increased within-group cooperation, but only up to a point. Increasing the level of competition between groups beyond this point produced the opposite effect.
